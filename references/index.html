The ACM code cites the following key references:

    <dt>[<a href="Rowe2004.pdf">Rowe2004</a>]</dt>
    <dd>An important precursor to this is the paper
        "A computationally tractable version of the collective model"
        by D.J. Rowe, Nucl. Phys. A 735 (2004) 372-392.</dd>

    <dd>Most of the calculations for the following paper were
        carried out using an earlier version of this code:
        "Bohr model as an algebraic collective model"
        by D.J. Rowe, T.A. Welsh and M.A. Caprio,
        Phys. Rev. C79 (2009) 054304.

    <dd>A pretty full explanation in Chapter 4 of the book
        "Fundamentals of Nuclear Models: Foundational Models"
        by D.J. Rowe and J.L. Wood,
        World Scientific (Singapore), 2010.

    <dd>This code implements the ACM version of the Bohr model of the
        atomic nucleus. The manuscript
        "A computer code for calculations in the algebraic collective
        model of the atomic nucleus",
        by T.A. Welsh and D.J. Rowe,
        describes the mathematical foundations of the code, and also
        serves as a manual. The manuscript (version 1.2) is available from
        http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.3824 (v2).
        (A slightly improved version 1.3 was submitted for publication;
        this is being updated to version 1.4 following referees' comments.)
