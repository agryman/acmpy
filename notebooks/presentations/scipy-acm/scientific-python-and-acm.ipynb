    "* Historically, a wide variety of computer languages have been used,\n",
    "    * e.g. Fortran, APL, Pascal, C, Mathematica, Maple, ...\n",
    "* The recent explosion of Internet data has stimulated the development of a powerful software and hardware stack for efficiently processing it\n",
    "* Python has emerged as the dominant platform for Data Science and Machine Learning\n",
    "* Python has a rich set of scientific capabilities that also make it well-suited for physics\n",
    "* this presentation reports on my experience converting the Welsh-Rowe ACM code from Maple to Python\n",
    "* based on this exercise, I conclude that Python is a very appropriate platform for the ACM and has many advantages over the alternatives"

    "Thus, we are optimistic that with a readily available computer code, the ACM, which can easily handle the full ACM with a variety of Hamiltonians, including its adiabatic and other approximations, would become a generally used tool.  But, no doubt I am being overly optimistic.  **That was our original hope but the use of Maple proved (I am assuming) to be the obstacle to this happening.**\n",

    "My guess is that the most widely used computer languages are C, fortran, and python (but really I am only guessing).  It would seem to make most sense, if we consulted the journal Comput. Phys. Commun.\n",
    "and if, for example, they would want to publish a short note with the inclusion of the more useable code **(I recall that, when we first submitted the code, they mentioned that the language would be a barrier to its usage, but at that point we were already committed)**.  I had no idea that Maple is now offering conversion possibilities.  It does seem like the way to go.\n",
