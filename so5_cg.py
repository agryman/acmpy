# This class implements the lookup of precomputed SO(5) > SO(3) Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.
# These coefficients are precomputed by another program and saved in a set of files.
# The files are arranged in a set of directories.
# The file and directory names encode some of the parameters of the coefficients.
# Each file contains a list of coefficient values, one per line, along with the remainder of their parameters.
